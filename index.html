            Summary
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have made this site to archive the history of the Texas high school state wrestling tournament from the very beginning. 
            The UIL has archived their tournaments since they started in 1999, but the vast majority of anything 
            before UIL has survived almost entirely on paper. This archive is not complete, but hopefully I will 
            be able to recover more information as time goes on. I have gotten most of the information on the 
            Pre-UIL tournament from old state programs and coaches' association newsletters. These records have 
            come from coaches and community members that cared to preserve the history just like I'm doing now. 
            As time goes on, 
            I will be updating the site to include placers, brackets, scans of old programs, and anything else 
            that I can find to preserve the history of Texas high school wrestling. I am also working on a way 
            to fetch statistics from the site to make it easier to find information about wrestlers, teams, and 
            tournaments.
        </p>
        <h2>
            About
        </h2>
        <p>
            My name is George Youtt, and I am the head boys wrestling coach at Lewisville High School. This is a 
            passion project of mine that I have put together in my spare time since 2020. I have done much of the 
            record-keeping, transcribing, and coding by hand, so I am sure that there are many mistakes throughout 
            the site. I would love to make this a community effort, so please reach out if you have any information, 
            corrections, or suggestions.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How can I help?
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you have any information&mdash;or a lead on any information&mdash;, corrections, or suggestions please 
            email me at 
            <a href="mailto:youtt@txhswrestling.com">youtt@txhswrestling.com</a>.
            The main thing I am looking for currently is any information about the tournaments from 1967 to 1984. The 
            only data I have for these years are the team champions.
        </p>
        <h3>
            I have new information.
        </h3>
        <p>
            If I am missing any information from a section, there will be a red list at the top of that page. If you 
            have any of that missing information, please send me a link at the address above. For now, I will need 
            a source for any new information. Here are some examples of acceptable sources:
            <ul>
                <li>State tournament programs</li>
                <li>Coaches' association newsletters</li>
                <li>School record boards</li>
                <li>Newspaper/magazine/yearbook articles (If you do not have these but remember the year and publication, I can probably find them.)</li>
                <li>Memorabilia, such as brackets, trophies, medals, plaques, patches, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if you do not have a source, I would still love to hear about any information that you have. I have 
            been able to collect pretty much everything back to 1986, but that still leaves about 20 years of missing 
            information. Any little bit helps. Please don't hesitate to reach out.
        </p>
        <h3>
            I have a correction.
        </h3>
        <p>
            I have done much of this record-keeping and transcribing by hand, so I am sure that there are many mistakes 
            throughout the site. There are also many inconsistencies in the records. Please let me know if you find 
            anything. I do not need sources for these necessarily, unless I receive conflicting information.
        </p>
        <h3>
            I have a suggestion.
        </h3>
        <p>
            I'm sure that there are a lot of things that I can be doing better. I would love to hear any suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I anticipate hearing about the naming conventions I've chosen for teams. For the most part, 
            I have used teams' trackwrestling names, with some minor tweaks here and there. This has mostly been done as 
            it is the easiest way to keep track of things in my mind as I've been transcribing the information from paper.
            Any current or former coach can reach out if they would prefer a different name for their team.
